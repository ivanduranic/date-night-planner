                “Date-Night Planner is highly poetic, sharp, and engaging app. It’s easy to fall in love with its ingenuity.
                This app is an ode to a deep appreciation of
                dating and to the dance of the masculine and feminine as old as time.”

                True art of preparing for the date-night is to understand the subtle dynamics of sub-communication
                between two people – the complex melodiousness of attraction, excitement, nervousness, envy, judgment,
                and desire in a social milieu… and how you can learn to seize it all in a spirit of fun and magic for
                everyone in your circle. You will be able to smile in your advanced years, knowing that you’ve
                experienced life at its fullest, that you have loved and been loved, and that you aren't having any
                regret.

                I don’t even remember how I came across this app but it was truly a magical gift. I must have attracted
                Date-Night Planner into my life. As a woman, I have to say, this is the best app I have ever used in my
                entire life.
