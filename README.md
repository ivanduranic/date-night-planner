## About
This is a date night planner application made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Materialize, Firebase, MomentJS and MapBox.
This application allows a user to enter a location and how far they are willing to travel. Based on this information, a list of theatres will be generated and displayed to the page. The user will be able to select a theatre, and a list of movies and their showtimes will be displayed. The user may then select a movie and specific show-time to book their tickets.
  You can launch the application by clicking [here.](https://ivanduranic.github.io/date-night-planner/) 
> Website URL: https://ivanduranic.github.io/date-night-planner/

## Pitch
Ever needed help planning a night out? Look no further! With this app you can search for movies playing at a theatre near your location, or you can specify a postal code. The app will show what movies are playing, at what theater, and the show times based on how far you’re willing to travel. You can purchase your tickets as soon as you've made your choices. Additionally, if you want a bite to eat, you can search for a restaurant as well. Just tell the app what food you’re in the mood for and it will give you a list of restaurants close to the theater. That way you don’t need to drive across town, get stuck in traffic, and be late for the movie!
  
## Instructions
1. Simply type in your location or allow access to get your geolocation
2. Enter how far you're willing to travel 
3. Once the button is clicked, a list of theatres will be generated and displayed based on your location and how far you were willing to travel
4. You may select a theatre; once you do, the application will show you a list of movies and their showtimes 
5. You may then select a movie and a showtime, and a button will be displayed which redirects you to a page to book/ purchase your movie tickets.

and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the

of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
