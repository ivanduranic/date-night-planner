                        <p>I was being chased by a giant dinosaur, but I think I've managed to give it the slip. Oh, you've got a dinosaur too! Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! That's a relief. I hate babysitters. Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. I've made many mistakes... and it's about time that I did something about that. No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. Once upon a time. The end. Dad skills. Once upon a time. The end. Dad skills. Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance. No, not the hugging. I'm against the hugging. I just have one question… do you know how to fly this thing? Well, you're very similar heights. Maybe you should wear labels. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. Your hips are fine, you're built like a man! Well, I would say that that person would be an egomaniac, need, game-player sort of person. He was dead already, I'm saving us. Follow me, and run! Shut up! Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shuttity up up up! Underneath it all I think you're probably kind and nice, and very brave. I just wish you weren't a soldier. Old ladies die all the time. It's practically in the job description. Five foot one and crying - you never stood a chance. I don't know. But I'd probably blame the English. So you've got a room for not being awake in. What's the point? You're just missing the room! My carer. She cares so I don't have to. It’s a bit more exciting when you go the other way.</p>
